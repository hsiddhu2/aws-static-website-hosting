![OUTPUT](ArchDiagram.png)

The advanced static website hosting architecture leverages several AWS services to deliver a high-performance, secure, and globally distributed static website. Here's an overview of the key components:

### 1. Amazon S3 Bucket

- The foundation of the architecture is an Amazon S3 bucket configured to host static website content.
- The S3 bucket is set up to enable static website hosting, allowing it to serve HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other assets.

### 2. Amazon CloudFront

- Amazon CloudFront is integrated with the S3 bucket to provide content delivery and acceleration.
- CloudFront improves website performance by caching content at edge locations worldwide.
- Custom SSL certificates from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) ensure secure connections.

### 3. Custom Domain Name

- A custom domain name (e.g., www.example.com) is associated with the CloudFront distribution.
- Route 53 is used for DNS management, routing traffic to the appropriate CloudFront distribution.

### 4. HTTPS and Security

- HTTPS is enforced using CloudFront and ACM, ensuring encrypted communication between clients and the website.
- Additional security measures include IAM policies and S3 bucket policies to restrict access.

### 5. Content Delivery and Acceleration

- CloudFront edge locations cache and deliver content to users, reducing latency and improving performance.
